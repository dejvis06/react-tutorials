## Core Concepts

### Components

Components are the building blocks of a React application. Each component is a piece of the user interface, which can be reused and composed to build complex UIs.

### State Management

State management refers to the practice of handling and sharing application state across various components. React provides built-in tools for managing state, such as hooks, context, and external libraries like Redux.

### Configuration
